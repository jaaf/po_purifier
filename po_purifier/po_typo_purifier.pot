"po_typo_purifier : A script to detect typo errors (and more ) in translated \n"
"files.\n"
"\n"
"USAGE:  popurifier.py [OPTIONS]\n"
"   \n"
"   OPTIONS:\n"
"      -h --help : display help \n"
"      -i --info : give the present info about how the program works\n"
"      -o --one-only =<rule num> : apply only this rule (not used at the moment)\n"
"      -t --trans-dir=<trans-dir> : indicate translation directory  \n"
"      -d --debug : execute program in debug mode\n"
"      -p : mark a pause after a change in a message\n"
"   \n"
"\n"
"The folder that contains the program must be placed aside the folder containing \n"
"the translations (.po files) or its parents. Most often, it is a folder named\n"
"after your locale e.g. fr, or fr_FR.UTF-8. \n"
"Sometimes it is a folder named \"locale\"\n"
"\n"
"The typographic rules lay in the typorules.py file in the same folder as \n"
"the program.\n"
"\n"
"The folder structure looks like the following:\n"
" \n"
"     --- --po_purifier ----- po_typo_purifier (prog)\n"
"        |               |\n"
"        |               |--- typorules.py \n"
"        |\n"
"   this |-- [locale] --- pot (.po files)\n"
"        |\n"
"    or  |-- <your locale> (.po files)\n"
"        |\n"
"    or  |-- anything  -- anything (.po files)\n"
"\n"
"The program can be launched from the typo_purifier folder with the following\n"
" command :\n"
"\n"
"     python3 po_typo_purifier.py\n"
" \n"
"Without any option, the program search for translation files (.po) in the \n"
"<locale> folder, where <locale> is you locale \n"
"(output by the 'echo $LANG' command). \n"
"\n"
"Whenever translated files (.po) are located elsewhere, use the \n"
"\n"
"     -t (--trans-dir) option \n"
"\n"
"to tell the program where to find them, e.g.:\"\n"
"\n"
"      python3 po_typo_purifier.py --trans-dir \"locale/pot\"\n"
"\n"
"A folder, named \"purified\" (this name is placed in the target variable) is \n"
"created aside the \"po_purifier\" folder. It receives the new files. You need to \n"
"use this folder to replace the initial translation folder, if  everything went \n"
"well.The original folder, should be renamed or moved before pushing onto zanata.\n"
"\n"
"IMPORTANT NOTE: you should always make a backup of the original folder to \n"
"be able to recover from something wrong happening while pushing onto zanata.\n"
"\n"
"The program establishes the list of the files that lay into the translation \n"
"folder. For each of them it reviews all the messages. The source messages (EN) \n"
"are copied line for line into the target file.\n"
"\n"
"The lines of the translated messages are concatenated to form a unique string, \n"
"then rules are applied in turn. Taking into account the possibility \n"
"of a lot of false positives, all the modifications need a confirmation from the \n"
"user.\n"
"\n"
"The message is displayed, first with colorized spaces, then with proposed\n"
"change over a green background.\n"
"\n"
"The user has several choices:\n"
"\n"
"     - y for yes: to accept the proposed change. In this case the message that \n"
"     will be written in the target file is displayed (light blue color) with the \n"
"     splitting in line used.\n"
"\n"
"     -c for change: to ask for a prior change into the rule matching string and \n"
"     the resume. This may be useful in certain circumstances such as a short \n"
"     dash used in place of a long dash that plays the role of parenthesis and \n"
"     to prevent rule from deleting spaces before and after.\n"
"     Changing the short dash with a long dash in this case, allows to keep the \n"
"     spaces and to  correct the fault in one shot.\n"
"\n"
"     - anything else: to refuse the proposal.\n"
"\n"
"Once the message has been corrected (or not), it is split in 80 char lines \n"
"anew. Then the lines are written in the target file.\n"
"\n"
"After that, the program passes to the next message until it reaches the end \n"
"of the file and passes to the next file.\n"
